# Introduction

All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that data types tell the variables the type of data they can store.

Pre-defined data types available in C++ are:
- **int**: Integer value 
- **unsigned int**: Can store only positive integers.
- **float, double**: Decimal number 
- **char**: Character values (including special characters) 
- **unsigned char**: Character values
- **bool**: Boolean values (true or false)
- **long**: Contains integer values but with the larger size
- **nsigned long**: Contains large positive integers or 0
- **short**: Contains integer values but with a smaller size

Table for datatype and its size in C++: (This can vary from compiler to compiler and system to system depending on the version you are using)

**Examples:**
```
int price = 5000;                     // Integer (whole number)
float interestRate = 5.99f;           // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';                  // Character
bool isPossible = true;               // Boolean
string myText = "Coding Ninjas";      // String
```

**auto keyword in C++**
The auto keyword specifies that the type of the declared variable will automatically be deduced from its initializer.  It would set the variable type to initialize that variableâ€™s value type or set the function return type as the value to be returned.

**Example:**
```
auto a = 11          // will set the variable a as int type
auto b = 7.65        //will set the variable b as float
auto c = "abcdefg"   // will set the variable c as string
```
