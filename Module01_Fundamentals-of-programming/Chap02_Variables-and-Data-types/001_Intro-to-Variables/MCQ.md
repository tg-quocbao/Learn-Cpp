## 2. Valid variable

- [ ] int 87var = 98;
- [ ] String _mTf5D_Hh = "hello";
- [ ] float friend = 8.9;

## Solutions
1. int true;
> As true is a keyword, and the rest are valid and follow the rules.

2. String _mTf5D_Hh = "hello";
> Since a variable cannot have any special character other than _, so option A is wrong, and it cannot start with a number; hence option B is invalid; also, the variable cannot be a keyword, so option C is wrong. Hence the correct answer is option C, as it follows all the rules.
