# Introduction 

C++ is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.

For this course, you will be provided with the in-built compiler of Coding Ninjas. However, if you want to run programs and practice them on your local desktop, various compilers like Code blocks, VS Code, Dev C++, Atom, and many more exist. You may choose one for yourself. 

## Features of C++

C++ provides a lot of features that are given below.

- Simple
- Portability
- Powerful and Fast
- Rich Library
- Platform Dependent
- Mid-level programming language
- Structured programming language
- Object-Oriented
- Case Sensitive
- Compiler Based
- Syntax based language
- Pointers
- Dynamic Memory Management

**1) Simple:** C++ is a simple language because it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), a rich set of library functions, data types, etc. It allows us to follow both procedural as well as functional approach to design our flow of control.

**2) Portability:** It is the concept of carrying the instruction from one system to another system. In C++, Language .cpp file contains source code, and we can also edit this code. .exe file contains the application, which is the only file that can be executed. When we write and compile any C++ program on the Windows operating system, it efficiently runs on other window-based systems.

**3) Powerful:** C++ is a very powerful programming language, and it has a wide variety of data types, functions, control statements, decision-making statements, etc. C++ is a fast language as compilation and execution time is less. Also, it has a wide variety of data types, functions & operators.

**4) Rich Library:** C++ library is full of in-built functions that save a tremendous amount of time in the software development process. As it contains almost all kinds of functionality, a programmer can need in the development process. Hence, saving time and increasing development speed.

**5) Platform Dependent:** Platform dependent language means the language in which programs can be executed only on that operating system where it is developed & compiled. It cannot run or execute on any other operating system. E.g., compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows.

**6) Mid-level programming language:** C++ can do both low-level & high-level programming. That is the reason why C++ is known as a mid-level programming language.

**7) Structured programming language:** C++ is a structured programming language as it allows to break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.

**8) Object-oriented:** C++ is an object-oriented programming language. OOPs make development and maintenance easier, whereas, in Procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size grows. It follows the concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction.

**9) Case sensitive:** C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. In C++ programming, 'break and BREAK' both are different.

**10) Compiler Based:** C++ is a compiler-based language, unlike Python. C++ programs used to be compiled, and their executable file is used to run it due to which C++ is a relatively faster language than Java and Python.

**11) Syntax-based language:** C++ is a strongly typed syntax-based programming language. If any language follows the rules and regulations strictly, it is known as a strongly syntax-based language.Other examples of syntax-based languages are C, C++, Java, .net etc.

**12) Pointer:** C++ supports pointers that allow the user to deal directly with the memory and control the programmer. This makes it very suitable for low-level tasks and very complicated projects. It is known to increase the speed of execution by decreasing the memory access overhead.

**13) Dynamic Memory Management:** It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can free the allocated memory by calling the free() function. These features are missing in languages like C.

## Uses of C++
There are several benefits of using C++ because of its features and security; below are some uses of C++ Programming Language:

**Operating Systems:** One of the key requirements of an Operating System is that it should be very fast as it is responsible for scheduling and running the user programs. The strongly typed and fast nature of C++ makes it an ideal candidate for writing operating systems. Also, C++ has a vast collection of system-level functions that also help in writing low-level programs. Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X, or Linux - all operating systems have some parts programmed in C++.

**Games:** Again since most of the games need to be faster to support smooth game play, C++ is extensively used in game design.  C++ can easily manipulate hardware resources, and it can also provide procedural programming for CPU-intensive functions.

**Browsers:** With the fast performance of C++, most browsers have their rendering software written in C++. Browsers are mostly used in C++ for rendering purposes. Rendering engines need to be faster in execution as most people do not like to wait for the web page to be loaded. 

**Libraries:** Many high-level libraries use C++ as the core programming language. For example, TensorFlow uses C++ as the back end programming language. Such libraries required high-performance computations because they involve multiplications of huge matrices to train Machine Learning models. As a result, performance becomes critical. C++ comes to the rescue in such libraries.

**Graphics:** C++ is widely used in almost all graphics applications that require fast rendering, image processing, real-time physics, and mobile sensors.

**Cloud/Distributed Systems:** Cloud storage systems use scalable file-systems that work close to the hardware; also, the multi threading libraries in C++ provide high concurrency and load tolerance. 

**Embedded Systems:** C++ is closer to the hardware level, and so it is quite useful in embedded systems as the software and hardware in these are closely coupled. Many embedded systems use C++, such as smartwatches, MP3 players, GPS systems, etc.

**Compilers:** Compilers of various programming languages use C++ as the back-end programming language.
